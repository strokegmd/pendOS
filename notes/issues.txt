there is listed some issues with pendOS developing:

1) linking errors (errors starts with fno stack):
there is some interesting fix: if you use any not debian-based linux distro, you can try use debootstrap.
on arch, you can install it using pacman -S debootstrap.
then, you can execute this command - sudo debootstrap bookworm FolderName
it will create debian emulation, and you can use it for compiling.

use compile-dbstrp.sh script for compiling
also copy pendos-compile.sh script to / of your debootstrap

if you use debian-based distro, there should be no errors with linking & compiling
